Old, Incomplete dff export scripts, written primarily in 2005/2006. To use:
-create your model
-apply a material to it (MANDATORY - will crash if no material is present!)

//script-specific
-open and evaluate 'dffexpfn' and 'dff_gui' (in that order)
-select everything you want to export (only geometry and dummy objects are supported)
-press the "export DFF" button (Update dff is only active after one export has been completed, it simply saves over the last exported dff file)
